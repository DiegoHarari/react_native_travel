# react_native_travel

This small app loads hotels info from an API and shows the results. 
Some of the gallery endpoint were broken and have no photos.
I decided to use React Query, i've didn't used it before, but i am always looking for the best approach and i try to be updated with the new tools.
In my daily basis i use TS, i decided not to use it here, as the application was small.
I am adding 3 screenshots of the final layout.
